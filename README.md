# Predict Length of Stay with Decision Tree-type, Ensemble and Neural Networks models

Extended project for the Computational Machine Learning course (2nd term). 

The repository contains 2 files: 
  - final jupyter notebook of the project
  - .py file that contains the extra functions that were created and used for this project

**Project Summary**

1. Preprocess data
    - create new features regarding length of stay + number of comorbidities
2. Create a data preprocessing pipeline with ColumnTransformer
3. Decision Tree model (with GridSearch)
4. Other Tree-type models (RandomForest, XGBoost, GradientBoost, AdaBoost)
5. Ensembling techniques
    - Stacking predictors
    - SuperLearner
    - Feature Propagation
6. Neural Netoworks
    - with sklearn
    - with tensorflow
7. Compare results and interpret best model with SHAP
